The following project is in compliance with the module 3 requirements for Programming Languages, a 2nd year 2nd term subject in Map√∫a Malayan Colleges Mindanao, to be presented to 
Professor Christopher Josh Dellosa, in said compliance for this module's requiremenets.

As for the content of the project itself, it is a simple CRUD system for retail businesses using logic paradigms. The project itself is not complex by any means, however, it is used to demonstrate
understanding and knowledge of logic/declarative paradigms and its implications as a future programmer. Again, the project itself is not complex by any means, so it is used more as proof that the presenters have
indeed learned and understood their assigned paradigms(which is logic/declarative in our case) and have knowledge on how to use it.
